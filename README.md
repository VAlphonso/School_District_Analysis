# PyCity School District Analysis

## Project Overview

  I have been tasked with creating an analysis for PyCity School District.  My point contact person is Maria.  Together, we will create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presentedin a table format.  The table will include the top and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate, the average math and reading score per student per grade per school and school performance based on budget per student, school size, and type of school.  
  Forthermore, evidence of academic dishonsety has been brought to the attention of the school board.  This erronious data will be taken into consideation and adjusted for in our analysis.  This will be accomplished by replacing the erronious data with "NaN" (not a number), a mathematical term used to describe an undefined value.  The effects of this change will be discussed in the results section of this report.
